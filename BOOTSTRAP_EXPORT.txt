# SYSTEM.md

## Architecture version
- 2.0

## Purpose
Agent Lab is a deterministic multi-agent portfolio research and publication system with a separated control-plane and execution layer.

## Canonical topology
- `control/` — control-plane documentation, invariants, and configuration context.
- `agents/node/` — Node intake/packaging agent and schema validation.
- `agents/scientist/` — Scientist execution pipeline (backtest, compare, publish, tests).
- `outputs/` — runtime and publication artifacts.
- `contracts/` — generated machine contracts and human briefs.

## Control-plane / execution separation
- Control-plane definitions live under `control/` and must not be treated as execution outputs.
- Execution code lives under `agents/`.
- Publication artifacts live under `outputs/`.

## Publication paths (canonical)
- Publish root: `outputs/reports/`
- Archive: `outputs/reports/archive/`
- Index: `outputs/reports/index.html`

## Publication entrypoint
- `agents/scientist/publish.py` is the publication entrypoint.

## Deterministic execution model
- Backtest execution is deterministic from local inputs and strategy configuration.
- Publish workflow invokes backtest generation before publication actions.

## Report naming invariant
Versioned report filename format is:
- `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_<strategy>.html`
- Timestamp is UTC minute precision.

## Index ordering invariant
- Index ordering and displayed publish time are derived from filename timestamps.
- Non-conforming filenames are treated as legacy rows by policy utilities.

## Publish workflow invariants
In `agents/scientist/publish.py`:
1. Resolve strategy and validate allowed publication scope.
2. Execute backtest generation for target strategy.
3. Create timestamped report in `outputs/reports/`.
4. Ensure `outputs/reports/archive/` exists and archive prior timestamped versions.
5. Regenerate `outputs/reports/index.html` from filename timestamps.
6. Stage repository changes with `git add -A`.
7. If staged changes exist, run pytest gate before push.
8. Commit and push to `origin/main`.
9. Enforce HEAD parity (`HEAD == origin/main`).

## Repository Identity Invariant
The following files must NOT exist at repository root:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `IDENTITY.md`
- `SOUL.md`
- `TOOLS.md`
- `USER.md`
- `HEARTBEAT.md`

Identity files are permitted ONLY in:
- `control/`
- `agents/node/`
- `agents/scientist/`

If root-level identity files are detected, this constitutes architectural drift and must be corrected before any publish action.

## Guardrails
### Modifiable
- `control/`
- `agents/node/`
- `agents/scientist/`
- `contracts/`

### Protected / caution
- `.git/`
- `outputs/` (artifact space; modify only via execution workflows unless explicitly requested)

## Multi-agent responsibility summary
- Node agent (`agents/node/`) validates and packages structured requests into contracts.
- Scientist agent (`agents/scientist/`) executes portfolio analytics and publication workflows.
- Control-plane (`control/`) defines architecture and invariants without replacing runtime truth.

## Control Commands
### generate bootstrap
When the phrase `generate bootstrap` is received, the system must:
1. Overwrite `./BOOTSTRAP_EXPORT.txt` at repository root.
2. Insert full unmodified contents of:
   - `control/SYSTEM.md`
   - `control/CONTEXT_BOOTSTRAP.md`
   - `control/system_config.yaml`
3. Preserve formatting exactly.
4. Confirm only `BOOTSTRAP_EXPORT.txt` changed.
5. Commit with message:
   - `Regenerate portable control-plane bootstrap export`
6. Push to `origin main`.
7. Confirm HEAD parity `TRUE`.

## Architecture version
- 2.0

## High-level architecture
Agent Lab uses a v2 multi-agent structure with explicit separation between control-plane definitions and execution runtime.

- Control-plane: `control/`
- Execution agents: `agents/node/`, `agents/scientist/`
- Artifacts/output plane: `outputs/`
- Contracts plane: `contracts/`

## Responsibility boundaries
### control/
- Owns architecture definitions, invariants, and configuration context.
- Must describe reality of repository state; it does not execute workloads.

### agents/node/
- Owns structured payload validation and request packaging.
- Produces contracts in `contracts/requests/` and briefs in `contracts/briefs/`.

### agents/scientist/
- Owns deterministic backtest execution (`backtest.py`).
- Owns comparative report generation (`compare.py`).
- Owns publication orchestration (`publish.py`).

### outputs/
- Owns publication artifacts and runtime artifacts.
- Canonical publish root is `outputs/reports/`.

## Publication model
- Entrypoint: `agents/scientist/publish.py`
- Publish root: `outputs/reports/`
- Archive path: `outputs/reports/archive/`
- Index path: `outputs/reports/index.html`
- Timestamped artifact format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_<strategy>.html` (UTC)
- Index ordering source: filename timestamp parsing

## Invariants
1. Publication writes timestamped reports under `outputs/reports/`.
2. Archive target is `outputs/reports/archive/` and must be created if missing.
3. Index regeneration targets `outputs/reports/index.html`.
4. Index ordering is derived from filename timestamps, not commit time.
5. Publish flow stages changes with `git add -A`.
6. Publish flow executes pytest gate before push when staged changes exist.
7. Publish flow commits and pushes to `origin/main` when changes exist.
8. HEAD parity is enforced at end of publish flow.

## Guardrails
### Modifiable paths
- `control/`
- `agents/node/`
- `agents/scientist/`
- `contracts/`

### Protected paths
- `.git/`
- `outputs/` (artifact plane; do not mutate manually unless explicitly requested)

## Existence assertions (repository state)
- `scientist-workspace/` does not exist in this repository.
- `reports/` at repository root does not exist in this repository.

## Deterministic operating posture
- Derive architecture from current repository state and live execution code.
- Do not assume legacy v1 topology.
- Keep control-plane statements aligned with runtime entrypoints and artifact paths.
