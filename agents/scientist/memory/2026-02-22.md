# 2026-02-22

- Ben tested agent boundaries in Discord (`#scientist-lab`) and confirmed he wanted capability checks without unintended actions.
- Confirmed this agent can access and write to `/home/bavor/agent-lab/agents/node` when explicitly requested.
- Completed requested export workflow: created repo-root `BOOTSTRAP_EXPORT.txt`, committed with message `Add portable bootstrap export`, pushed to `origin/main`, and verified local `main` == `origin/main`.
- Ben requested SYSTEM regeneration as a reconstruction from current filesystem state (not legacy assumptions), with explicit instruction: do **not** auto-commit; provide full proposed `SYSTEM.md` for review only.
