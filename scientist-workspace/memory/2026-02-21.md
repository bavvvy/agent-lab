## Durable updates

- Standardized comparison report naming to timestamp-first format:
  - from `comparison_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.html`
  - to `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_comparison.html`
  - commit: `REPORT: Standardize comparison report naming to timestamp-first format` (`5e54fac`).

- Expanded comparative analytics layer in `scientist-workspace/compare.py` using only canonical per-strategy datasets in `scientist-workspace/output/<strategy>.parquet`.
  - Added full-period metrics, rolling 60M overlays, downside diagnostics, regime slices, distribution diagnostics, and conclusion block.
  - commit: `ANALYTICS: Expand comparative analytics layer (data-driven only)` (`1fcb0c6`).

- Implemented "latest-only at root, older versions archived" behavior while keeping timestamped filenames/invariants:
  - publish flow now moves older root `*_<strategy>.html` files to `reports/archive/` before writing newest root timestamped report.
  - comparison flow now keeps only newest `*_comparison.html` in root and archives older ones.
  - `reports/index.html` now has separate **Current Reports** (root) and **Archive** sections.
  - commit: `ENGINE: Expose latest timestamped report per strategy (archive older versions)` (`85bf2cc`).

- Confirmed after rollout:
  - one root timestamped HTML per strategy/comparison,
  - older reports preserved in `reports/archive/`,
  - HEAD parity true and git status clean at completion.
